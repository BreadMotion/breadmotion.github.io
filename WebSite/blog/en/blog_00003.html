              <section class="post-detail__body markdown-body"><p>Hello! I&#39;m PanKUN.</p>
<p>Using <strong>Odin Inspector</strong> in an indie project, I created a <strong>project-specific &quot;Context Editor&quot;</strong> that planners can touch even if they don&#39;t have much knowledge of Unity.</p>
<p>The &quot;Context Editor&quot; referred to here is an image of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A tool that allows you to edit data related to XX in the game all at once on a single screen&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Character and stage parameters</li>
<li>Display text and descriptions</li>
<li>Reward tables and flag settings</li>
</ul>
<p>The story is that <strong>I made it possible to edit information that I want to handle as a group from a single location</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>Originally, the project managed data structures with ScriptableObject and CSV, but there were issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to understand &quot;which data is where&quot;</li>
<li>It is necessary to <strong>open many assets</strong> to change parameters</li>
<li>It takes time for planners to search through the Unity Project window</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I made a <strong>dedicated editing screen (Context Editor)</strong> with Odin where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When touching the specifications of XX, just open this window for now&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roughly summarizing what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created a <strong>dedicated window</strong> using Odin&#39;s <code>OdinEditorWindow</code></li>
<li><strong>Bound ScriptableObjects collectively</strong> that planners are expected to touch</li>
<li>Implemented filtering, searching, button operations, etc. quickly with Odin attributes</li>
<li><strong>Guarded &quot;items that should not be touched&quot; with ReadOnly / Foldout / Box, etc.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the configuration.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-i-wanted-to-do">What I wanted to do</h2><p>In this context editor, I mainly aimed for the following experiences.</p>
<h3 id="1-understanding-quotwhere-to-touchquot-at-a-glance">1. Understanding &quot;where to touch&quot; at a glance</h3><ul>
<li>Even if planners are not familiar with Unity,<ul>
<li><strong>Categories on the left</strong></li>
<li><strong>Contents to edit on the right</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I made it so that parameters can be touched with a feeling of &quot;opening Excel&quot; in this form.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separating each section with <code>Foldout</code> and <code>Title</code> attributes</li>
<li>Preparing a frame summarizing only &quot;wording displayed in the game&quot;</li>
<li>Management IDs and internal flags are ReadOnly and display only</li>
</ul>
<p>I make full use of Odin&#39;s decoration attributes like this.</p>
<h3 id="2-being-able-to-edit-related-data-across-the-board">2. Being able to edit related data across the board</h3><p>For example, if it is a context of &quot;XX Event&quot;,</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic settings for the entire event</li>
<li>Difficulty table for each stage</li>
<li>Reward table</li>
<li>Text for guidance</li>
</ul>
<p>I made it possible to <strong>arrange and edit information divided into separate ScriptableObjects in one window</strong>.</p>
<p>By using Odin&#39;s <code>InlineEditor</code> and <code>TableList</code>,</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the referenced ScriptableObject by expanding it on the spot</li>
<li>Edit arrays/lists in table format</li>
</ul>
<p>I was able to paste such UI onto the custom EditorWindow side.</p>
<h3 id="3-making-it-so-that-only-safe-ranges-can-be-touched">3. Making it so that only safe ranges can be touched</h3><ul>
<li>Fields that I want planners to see but not touch</li>
<li>Flags that are dangerous to change during development</li>
</ul>
<p>For these things, I included ingenuities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locking with <code>ReadOnly</code> attribute</li>
<li>Not showing at all with <code>HideIf</code> / <code>ShowIf</code></li>
<li>Showing notes with <code>InfoBox</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I was conscious of making it a <strong>&quot;UI that leaves freedom but is hard to break&quot;</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="implementation-configuration">Implementation Configuration</h2><p>The technical configuration is roughly like this.</p>
<h3 id="1-base-window-class">1. Base Window Class</h3><ul>
<li>Prepare <code>ContextEditorWindow</code> inheriting <code>OdinEditorWindow</code></li>
<li>Make it openable from the menu with <code>MenuItem</code> attribute</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using Sirenix.OdinInspector;
using Sirenix.OdinInspector.Editor;
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;

public class ContextEditorWindow : OdinEditorWindow
{
    [MenuItem(&quot;Tools/Context Editor&quot;)]
    private static void Open()
    {
        GetWindow&lt;ContextEditorWindow&gt;(&quot;Context Editor&quot;);
    }

    // List targets for planners to touch here
    [Title(&quot;Event Basic Settings&quot;)]
    [InlineEditor(Expanded = true)]
    public EventConfig eventConfig;

    [Title(&quot;Stage Settings&quot;)]
    [TableList]
    public StageConfig[] stages;

    [Title(&quot;Reward Settings&quot;)]
    [TableList]
    public RewardConfig[] rewards;

    // If necessary, place search/filter fields here as well
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just by opening the window,</p>
<ul>
<li>The contents of the specified ScriptableObject are expanded on the <strong>same screen</strong></li>
<li>Values are edited on the spot, and saving is reflected</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create such a state.</p>
<h3 id="2-design-on-scriptableobject-side">2. Design on ScriptableObject side</h3><p>If you make the original data structure into a ScriptableObject beforehand,</p>
<ul>
<li>Use as a ScriptableObject as usual in the entire project</li>
<li>Access from the context editor window only when editing</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use it in double ways like this.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = &quot;Game/Event&quot;)]
public class EventConfig : ScriptableObject
{
    [LabelText(&quot;Event Name&quot;)]
    public string eventName;
    
    [LabelText(&quot;Period&quot;)]
    public string durationText;
    
    [LabelText(&quot;Description&quot;)]
    public string description;
    
    [LabelText(&quot;Enabled Flag&quot;)]
    public bool isEnabled;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you reference this as a field of the ContextEditorWindow mentioned earlier,
when doing InlineEditor on the window side, <strong>it will be displayed including Odin decorations</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="3-little-ux-improvements">3. Little UX improvements</h3><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Button to &quot;Launch test scene only for the selected stage&quot;</li>
<li>Button to &quot;Initialize reward table with default values&quot;</li>
<li>Button to &quot;Search and focus data with specific ID&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use Odin&#39;s Button attribute, you can output methods as buttons directly in the EditorWindow,
so you can easily add a little tool feeling.</p>
<h2 id="actually-trying-to-operate">Actually trying to operate</h2><p>The merits felt by having planners actually use it were like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>The entrance was fixed as &quot;When you want to touch this spec, just open this window&quot;</li>
<li>Time spent wandering around Unity&#39;s Project window and Inspector decreased</li>
<li>It became easier to log parameter updates and communication (easier to say &quot;I changed here on this screen&quot;)</li>
<li>Since parts that would be troublesome if operated by mistake can be locked from the beginning, accidents decreased</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, as challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintenance cost of the context editor itself occurs</li>
<li>When tinkering with the data structure, it is necessary not to forget to reflect on the Editor side as well</li>
<li>If you build the UI too much, it becomes too much of a &quot;dedicated tool&quot; and flexibility drops</li>
</ul>
<p>There were also points like that.</p>
<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2><p>The context editor using Odin felt quite compatible when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to create a &quot;Unity tool that planners can touch directly&quot;</li>
<li>You want to quickly prepare a &quot;project-specific editing screen&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>In cases where Inspector extensions alone are not enough, but creating an EditorWindow from scratch is hard,
just combining Odin attributes and EditorWindow makes it easy to create a tool of &quot;just the right line&quot;.</p>
<p>In the future, I would like to challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>A version with a little more organized UI/UX</li>
<li>Abstraction that can be reused in other projects</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested, I will dig deeper into concrete code and how to use attributes in another article, so I would be happy if you could read it again.</p>
