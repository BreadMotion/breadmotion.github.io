              <section class="post-detail__body markdown-body"><p>Hello! I&#39;m PanKUN.</p>
<p>Until now, clicking a work from the &quot;Portfolio List&quot; on this site would transition to a detail page (<code>portfolio/xxxx.html</code>).</p>
<p>However, people who come to see the portfolio probably want to &quot;<strong>zap through various works</strong>&quot;.
Operations like &quot;click to move to details&quot; -&gt; &quot;back with browser back&quot; -&gt; &quot;scroll again to the next work...&quot; are quietly stressful.</p>
<p>So I modified it to <strong>display detailed information in a modal window superimposed while maintaining the list page</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="implementation-policy">Implementation Policy</h2><p>This site generates static HTML files from Markdown files using build tools.
Portfolio detail pages already exist as actual files like <code>portfolio/work_01.html</code>.</p>
<p>There is also a method of packing all information into JSON data and building it with JS, but
<strong>&quot;reusing already generated HTML of detail pages&quot;</strong> is less wasteful in terms of SEO and build flow.</p>
<h3 id="process-flow">Process Flow</h3><ol>
<li>User clicks a card.</li>
<li>JS <code>fetch</code>es the detail page URL (<code>portfolio/xxxx.html</code>).</li>
<li>Parse the retrieved HTML text and extract only the content part inside.</li>
<li>Throw it into the modal.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="technical-points">Technical Points</h2><h3 id="1-fetch-html-and-parse">1. Fetch HTML and Parse</h3><p>What can be obtained with <code>fetch</code> is just a &quot;string&quot;. Use <code>DOMParser</code> to handle this as a DOM element.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Get HTML
const res = await fetch(contentPath);
const text = await res.text();

// Parse string as HTML document
const parser = new DOMParser();
const doc = parser.parseFromString(text, &quot;text/html&quot;);

// Extract only the necessary part (.work-detail)
const detail = doc.querySelector(&quot;.work-detail&quot;);

// Insert into modal
modalContent.appendChild(detail);
</code></pre>
<p>With this, you can embed content seamlessly without using <code>iframe</code>.</p>
<h3 id="2-trap-of-relative-paths">2. Trap of Relative Paths</h3><p>Since detail pages are built on the premise that they are under the <code>portfolio/</code> directory, paths for images etc. are like <code>../assets/img/...</code>.
If you display this as is in the modal of the top page (root hierarchy), the links will be broken.</p>
<p>Therefore, I performed path rewriting processing on the extracted DOM.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Fix paths starting with &quot;../&quot;
function fixPaths(element) {
  const nodes = element.querySelectorAll(&#39;[src], [href]&#39;);
  nodes.forEach((node) =&gt; {
    // Attribute value acquisition and replacement processing such as removing &quot;../&quot;
    // ...
  });
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2 id="stuck-point-content-not-displayed">Stuck Point: Content Not Displayed?</h2><p>When I implemented it and tried to move it, a phenomenon occurred where the modal opens but <strong>the content is pure white</strong>.
Looking at the developer tools, the element exists, but it is not reflected on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="cause-scroll-animation">Cause: Scroll Animation</h3><p>The cause was the class <code>reveal-on-scroll</code> used on the detail page side to &quot;display softly when scrolled&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.reveal-on-scroll {
    opacity: 0; /* Initially transparent */
    transform: translateY(20px);
    /* Becomes opaque with .is-visible when scrolled into screen */
}
</code></pre>
<p>When displaying as a detail page, the scroll detection script works, so there is no problem, but
when inserted into the modal, that script does not move, and it ended up <strong>waiting with <code>opacity: 0</code> forever</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3><p>I decided to remove this class before inserting it into the modal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const detail = doc.querySelector(&quot;.work-detail&quot;);
// Force display by removing animation class
detail.classList.remove(&quot;reveal-on-scroll&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>With this, it is now displayed safely.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>I think the viewing experience (UX) of works has improved considerably with this modification.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can view crisply because there is no page transition.</li>
<li>Easy to search from where you left off because the scroll position of the list is maintained.</li>
<li>Direct links to detail pages (SEO) are also maintained.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without giving up &quot;because it&#39;s a static site&quot;, by using JavaScript well, I was able to realize rich behavior like a dynamic site.</p>
