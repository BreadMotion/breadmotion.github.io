              <section class="post-detail__body markdown-body"><p>Hello! I&#39;m PanKUN.</p>
<p>This time, I will summarize the troubles that occurred when introducing <strong>Odin Inspector</strong> in an indie project and the actions taken at that time.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the situation was:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Differences appear in <code>.meta</code> files related to Odin</strong></li>
<li>Unity <strong>only starts in Safe Mode</strong> in some environments</li>
<li>Errors related to Test Framework also appear</li>
</ul>
<p>It did not reproduce in my environment, and since &quot;people for whom it works&quot; and &quot;people for whom it doesn&#39;t&quot; were mixed, it was necessary to isolate the cause and establish response rules within the team.</p>
<p>In this article, I will write from the perspective of <strong>&quot;doing this makes it less likely to cause accidents during the initial introduction&quot;</strong> based on the steps actually taken.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="organizing-error-details">Organizing Error Details</h2><p>First, I will organize the symptoms that were actually occurring within the team.</p>
<h3 id="1-differences-and-warnings-in-meta-files">1. Differences and warnings in meta files</h3><p>In the environment of some members, differences occurred in <code>.meta</code> files related to Odin, and warnings like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Invalid meta file exists</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or errors where Odin-related assemblies were not recognized correctly appeared.</p>
<h3 id="2-starting-in-safe-mode">2. Starting in Safe Mode</h3><ul>
<li>It starts normally in my environment</li>
<li><strong>Unity can only be opened in Safe Mode</strong> for other members</li>
</ul>
<p>This became the state.</p>
<p>Even though there was no problem when I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imported Odin</li>
<li>Performed <code>Clean -&gt; Checkout</code> in another local project to verify</li>
</ul>
<p>I received reports that only some members were sent to Safe Mode.</p>
<h3 id="3-test-framework-errors">3. Test Framework Errors</h3><p>When I looked at the logs in Safe Mode, there were patterns where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Errors related to Test Framework</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>were appearing separately from Odin.</p>
<p>Unity&#39;s Test Framework is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity Editor top menu:
<code>Window &gt; General &gt; Test Runner (name varies slightly depending on version)</code></li>
<li>A package for writing unit tests using attributes like <code>[Test]</code> in code</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as reading the logs, it seemed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Somewhere related to Odin <strong>depends on the Test Framework</strong></li>
<li>However, the Test Framework is broken / unreadable in some members&#39; environments</li>
</ul>
<p>However, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>The version of Test Framework on <code>Packages/manifest.json</code> is consistent</li>
<li>It works without problems with the same version in my other projects</li>
</ul>
<p>I judged that <strong>the package itself is not broken</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="possible-causes">Possible Causes</h2><p>Here are some likely causes while looking at the logs.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Version differences in Unity / Odin / Test Framework</strong><ul>
<li>Only specific members have different Unity minor versions</li>
<li>The version when Odin was imported is slightly different</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>State differences in <code>.meta</code> files or <code>Library</code></strong><ul>
<li>The <code>Library</code> folder remains old</li>
<li>Some <code>.meta</code> files are generated only locally and not uploaded to Git</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Difference in installation state of Test Framework</strong><ul>
<li>Once deleted or disabled on Package Manager</li>
<li>Cache is broken and re-import is not completed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, rather than &quot;one of these&quot;, it felt like <strong>multiple conditions overlapped and caused it to be sent to Safe Mode</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="actual-response-procedures">Actual Response Procedures</h2><p>From here, I will organize and write down the procedures that the team actually followed.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-unify-everyone39s-work-procedures">Step 1: Unify everyone&#39;s work procedures</h3><p>First, we fixed <strong>&quot;what to do after Pulling&quot;</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do <code>git pull</code></li>
<li>With Unity closed<ul>
<li>Delete the <code>Library</code> folder</li>
<li>Delete <code>Temp</code> and <code>obj</code> if necessary (optional)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Restart Unity and <strong>wait for the initial re-import to finish</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since there were several members who were not doing this,
I documented the procedure and shared it via Discord / DM, unifying it as <strong>&quot;Start from here&quot;</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since this alone fixed it for some people,
I recommend distributing a &quot;procedure manual set&quot; when introducing Odin.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="step-2-check-status-of-odin-and-test-framework">Step 2: Check status of Odin and Test Framework</h3><p>Next, for <strong>members who still had problems</strong>, I asked them to check the package status.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <code>Window &gt; Package Manager</code></li>
<li>Check the version of <strong>Odin</strong><ul>
<li>Is it consistent with the imported version?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check <strong>Test Framework</strong> on <code>Unity Registry</code> side<ul>
<li>Is it installed?</li>
<li>Is the version the same as other members?</li>
<li>Is the status not <code>Error</code> / waiting for <code>Resolve</code>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Test Framework seems broken:</p>
<ol>
<li>Temporarily &quot;Remove&quot; the Test Framework package</li>
<li>Restart Unity</li>
<li>Re-install Test Framework from Package Manager again</li>
</ol>
<p>I asked them to re-import in this way.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-organizing-meta-differences">Step 3: Organizing <code>.meta</code> differences</h3><p>If there are differences in <code>.meta</code> files related to Odin:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, <strong>commit the correct state of Odin + meta</strong> to the repository side</li>
<li>Then, for other members:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-text">  1. Evacuate local changes in work branch (stash or commit)
  2. Sync to latest branch
  3. Delete Library
  4. After restarting Unity, check if .meta differences related to Odin appear
</code></pre>
<p>I asked them to move in this flow.</p>
<p>The idea is to set the &quot;working environment&quot; as correct and fix it in the repository, then align other environments to it.</p>
<h2 id="operation-rules-when-introducing-odin-in-a-team">Operation Rules when introducing Odin in a team</h2><p>Based on this trouble, I will summarize the points I decided to be careful about in the next project onwards.</p>
<h3 id="1-decide-a-quotperson-in-chargequot-before-introduction">1. Decide a &quot;person in charge&quot; before introduction</h3><ul>
<li>Selection of Odin version</li>
<li>Import to project</li>
<li>Initial commit</li>
</ul>
<p>It is less likely to cause accidents if <strong>one person in charge does this all at once</strong>.</p>
<p>If multiple people import individually in a halfway state,
.meta and manifest.json tend to become messy.</p>
<h3 id="2-document-quotassumed-versionsquot-of-unity--odin--test-framework">2. Document &quot;assumed versions&quot; of Unity / Odin / Test Framework</h3><ul>
<li>At the start of the project<ul>
<li>Unity version</li>
<li>Odin version</li>
<li>Test Framework version
write these down in some document.
It becomes sufficient just to guide members joining later to &quot;please match this&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-write-initial-setup-procedures-in-readme">3. Write initial setup procedures in README</h3><p>Like what we did this time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things to do after git clone / git pull<ul>
<li>Delete Library</li>
<li>Restart Unity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confirmation points when it didn&#39;t start well<ul>
<li>Status check of Odin / Test Framework</li>
<li>Ask to report with logs attached when it becomes Safe Mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just by making a simple procedure manual for such contents, the communication cost during trouble drops considerably.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Summarizing what I learned from this Odin introduction, it looks like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Odin itself is convenient, but it is easy to have accidents due to differences in &quot;Unity / Test Framework / meta files&quot; during team introduction</li>
<li>It is easy to adopt a policy of deciding one &quot;working environment&quot;, committing the state of Odin + Test Framework from there, and aligning other members&#39; environments to that state</li>
<li>Just <strong>documenting the procedure and assumed version lightly in advance</strong> makes it much safer</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Odin is a quite powerful tool around custom inspectors and editor extensions,
once you can create a form that can be introduced stably in a team, <strong>projects from the next one onwards will be much easier</strong>.</p>
<p>I hope to write about what features I am actually making with Odin (attribute-based Editor extensions, ingenuity of Data management, etc.) in another article in the future.</p>
