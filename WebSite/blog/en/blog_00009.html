              <section class="post-detail__body markdown-body"><p>Hello! I&#39;m PanKUN.</p>
<p>This time, I will summarize <strong>how to create an environment where you can write Unity C# comfortably with the Zed editor</strong>, which I have been switching to recently.</p>
<p>In conclusion,</p>
<ul>
<li>Zed alone cannot parse Unity C#.</li>
<li>It is necessary to configure and use an external C# language server (csharp-language-server).</li>
<li>You can easily get stuck even with insufficient .NET runtime versions.</li>
<li>Since Unity projects are huge, it becomes heavy if you don&#39;t narrow down the &quot;folders to open&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are such characteristics.</p>
<p>In this article, I summarized the errors I encountered while actually running Zed in my environment and what I did to solve them.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-unity-c-doesn39t-work-in-zed">Why Unity C# doesn&#39;t work in Zed</h2><p>Zed does not have standard C# support for Unity like VSCode or Rider.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<ul>
<li>C# syntax parsing</li>
<li>Completion</li>
<li>Definition jump</li>
<li>Workspace reading</li>
</ul>
<p>cannot be done.</p>
<p>However, there is a language server called Omnisharp that can be installed from Zed&#39;s Extension! But...
It doesn&#39;t work (at least on Windows).</p>
<p>I looked it up and found there was nothing I could do, so let&#39;s wait for an update regarding this Omnisharp...</p>
<p>So, I will change the LSP used this time to <strong>csharp-language-server</strong> and make it work.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-you-need-before-introduction">What you need before introduction</h2><p>Please introduce the following.
I will describe how to introduce these somewhere else. (It&#39;s not particularly difficult, so if you search, quite a few will come up.)</p>
<ul>
<li>.Net runtime (9.0 upper)</li>
<li>Node.js (I believe 20 upper)</li>
<li>Omnisharp (Install from Zed Extension)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="download-csharp-language-server">Download csharp-language-server</h2><p>If you have cargo, use the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cargo install --git https://github.com/SofusA/csharp-language-server
</code></pre>
<p>If you don&#39;t have it, please get the binary for Windows from Releases on the official page.
The page is <a href="https://github.com/SofusA/csharp-language-server">here</a>
Don&#39;t forget to pass the path to the stored location from environment variables.</p>
<p>This time I will go with the following.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">C:\\Users\\&lt;User Name&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\csharp-language-server\\csharp-language-server.exe
</code></pre>
<h2 id="link-language-server-to-zed-settings">Link language server to Zed settings</h2><p>Open Zed&#39;s Settings.json (please match which Setting.json to your environment).</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;languages&quot;: {
    &quot;CSharp&quot;: {
      &quot;language_servers&quot;: [&quot;omnisharp&quot;],
      &quot;roots&quot;: [&quot;*.sln&quot;, &quot;*.csproj&quot;, &quot;.git&quot;]
    }
  },
  &quot;lsp&quot;: {
    &quot;omnisharp&quot;: {
      &quot;binary&quot;: {
        &quot;path&quot;: &quot;C:\\Users\\&lt;User Name&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\csharp-language-server\\csharp-language-server.exe&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Restart Zed and try opening a suitable .cs file.
It should work just with this.</p>
<h3 id="zed39s-omnisharp-extension-grabs-old-folder-and-causes-error">Zed&#39;s OmniSharp extension grabs old folder and causes error</h3><p>Manual deletion of the csharp folder in <strong>extensions/work</strong> within the directory where Zed software is stored might solve it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="if-it-didn39t-work">If it didn&#39;t work</h2><ol>
<li>Open command palette with &quot;Ctrl + Shift + P&quot; on Zed.</li>
<li>Get log with <code>zed: open log</code>.</li>
<li>Throw it to AI and ask or search the error log.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s solve it like that;;
Honestly, there are few articles, so throwing it to AI is stable.</p>
<p>(Zed has insane affinity with AI Agents, so that&#39;s fine too.
Gemini 3.0 was released yesterday, so I&#39;m using that^^)</p>
<p>Also, there are cases where <strong>LSP is running but cannot jump to definition</strong>.
It seems that completion across assemblies does not work until the target file is opened.
Let&#39;s open the relevant file with &quot;Ctrl + E&quot;. Completion will start working.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-operation-feel">Final operation feel</h2><ul>
<li>Completion: Light</li>
<li>Definition jump: Works without problems within the range where source exists</li>
<li>External DLL: Jump is impossible (Specification, but possible for self-made DLLs)</li>
<li>Not as much as Unity 100% IDE, but quite comfortable (Debugging seems impossible...)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lighter than VSCode, simpler than Rider.
Personally, I really liked it as an &quot;editor when I want to write Unity lightly&quot;!</p>
