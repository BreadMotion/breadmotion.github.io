              <section class="post-detail__body markdown-body"><p>Hello! I&#39;m PanKUN.</p>
<p>As I repeated adding features and changing designs, classes like <strong>&quot;Where is this used again?&quot;</strong> started to increase in my CSS files.</p>
<ul>
<li>A button class written for Design Plan A, but eventually Plan B was adopted so it became unused.</li>
<li>A style created to be common, but ended up being left alone because a specific class was used.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.
It works even if left alone, but it wastes file size and above all, it&#39;s not good for mental health.</p>
<p>So, I decided to refactor these this time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="searching-manually-is-impossible">Searching manually is impossible</h2><p>However, searching for class names written in CSS files one by one to confirm &quot;zero usage&quot; is an ordeal.
There are convenient tools like <code>PurgeCSS</code> in the world, but incorporating them into the build process can be a bit difficult or the settings can be complicated.</p>
<p>Since my motivation this time was <strong>&quot;I want to delete unnecessary things more easily and roughly&quot;</strong>, I decided to write a simple script in Node.js to detect them.</p>
<h2 id="policy-of-the-self-made-script">Policy of the self-made script</h2><ol>
<li>Read all CSS files in the <code>assets/css/</code> folder.</li>
<li>Extract class names (<code>.classname</code>) and ID names (<code>#idname</code>) using regular expressions.</li>
<li>Scan all files in the project (HTML, JS, MD, etc.).</li>
<li>If &quot;the extracted class name never appears in any file&quot;, output it as an <strong>unused candidate</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s it. I don&#39;t do strict syntax analysis (AST) etc., but judge by simple string search (<code>includes</code>).
To that extent, there is a weakness that &quot;detection will be missed if the same word as the class name happens to be in the text&quot;, but it is sufficient for the purpose of <strong>&quot;safely deleting unused things&quot;</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// tools/find-unused-css.js (excerpt)

const cssContent = fs.readFileSync(cssFile, &#39;utf8&#39;);
const selectors = extractSelectors(cssContent); // Extract with regex

selectors.forEach(sel =&gt; {
    let isUsed = false;
    for (const content of contents) {
        // Simple string search
        if (content.includes(sel.name)) {
            isUsed = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (!isUsed) {
        console.log(`[UNUSED] ${sel.name}`);
    }
});
</code></pre>
<h2 id="execution-result">Execution Result</h2><p>When I ran the script, I found several unused classes.</p>
<pre><code>Checking assets\css\layout.css...
  [UNUSED] .section--soft

Checking assets\css\top.css...
  [UNUSED] .btn-outline
</code></pre>
<p>Upon checking,
<code>section--soft</code> was a variation of a card made in the initial design draft,
<code>btn-outline</code> was a button with only a border, and currently only filled buttons were used.</p>
<p>These are completely unnecessary, so delete them without hesitation!
The CSS file has become a little slimmer.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Refactoring tends to be imagined as a large-scale task, but
if you take the approach of <strong>&quot;write a small script and check quickly if you are curious&quot;</strong>,
it seems possible to keep the code clean on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure unique to engineers to improve their own site with tools made by their own hands.</p>
