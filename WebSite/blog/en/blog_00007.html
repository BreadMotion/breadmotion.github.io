              <section class="post-detail__body markdown-body"><p>Hello! I&#39;m PanKUN.</p>
<p>Link with Google Drive on Windows and manage large files with rclone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of WinGet</li>
<li>Installation of rclone</li>
<li>Google Drive remote settings</li>
<li>Operation check
I summarized these steps into a single flowchart and visualized it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rclone-introduction-flow-mermaid-version">RClone Introduction Flow (Mermaid version)</h2><p>The final version of the flowchart is <a href="https://breadmotion.github.io/WebSite/content/other/Rclone.html">here</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="what-can-this-flow-do">What can this flow do?</h2><p>This flow visualizes the following series of tasks in a Windows environment so that they can be executed without mistakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>What to do if WinGet is missing</li>
<li>Installation of rclone</li>
<li>Google Drive remote settings</li>
<li>How to get Drive Folder ID</li>
<li>Operation check procedure</li>
</ul>
<p>You can eliminate &quot;stuck points in building a Git LFS substitute environment in Windows&quot; for yourself and your team.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>This is how to share files so that they can be managed outside the limits of Git LFS in a Windows environment.
The rough flow is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of WinGet</li>
<li>Introduction of RClone</li>
<li>RClone settings</li>
</ul>
<p>Since what follows becomes a story of operation method,
and if aiming at people who are not used to CLI, one more ingenuity is necessary, so I plan to describe it in another article.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>What I did in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visualized steps required for RClone introduction</li>
<li>Flowcharted with Mermaid</li>
<li>Points to note for Drive integration (root_folder_id etc.)</li>
<li>Organized content to be usable as a procedure manual for teams</li>
</ul>
