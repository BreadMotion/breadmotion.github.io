              <section class="post-detail__body markdown-body"><p>Hello! This is Pan-kun.</p>
<p>This time, I&#39;ve summarized <strong>Text Thread</strong> and <strong>slash commands</strong> related to the AI features of the Zed editor.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/blog_00017_0.png" alt="Zed&#39;s Text Thread and Slash Commands" title="" /></p>
<h2 id="what-is-text-thread">What is Text Thread?</h2><p>Zed&#39;s Assistant Panel (AI chat screen) is not just a chat UI, but is actually treated as an <strong>editor buffer</strong>.
In other words, you can do the following just like with a normal text file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use cursor operations and shortcut keys as they are</li>
<li>Open multiple AI chats as tabs</li>
<li>Save the contents of the conversation as a text file</li>
</ul>
<p>By utilizing this, it becomes possible to save past technical consultations as <code>.md</code> files and manage them as a knowledge base.</p>
<h2 id="accelerate-routine-processing-with-slash-commands-">Accelerate Routine Processing with Slash Commands (<code>/</code>)</h2><p>While the <code>@</code> introduced last time was a function to specify the context (reference files, etc.),
<strong>slash commands (<code>/</code>)</strong> are a function to <strong>call specific instructions (prompts) to the AI</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, you can register frequently used instructions such as &quot;Refactor this code,&quot; &quot;Translate to Japanese,&quot; and &quot;Write unit tests&quot; as commands starting with <code>/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h3><p>When you enter <code>/</code> in the input field of the Assistant Panel, a list of registered commands is displayed.
Simply select one and press Enter to expand the pre-configured prompt.</p>
<p>The part that you used to type in manually, such as &quot;Please explain about ~&quot;, can now be done with just <code>/explain</code>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-your-own-slash-commands">Creating Your Own Slash Commands</h3><p>A powerful feature of Zed is that you can define these slash commands yourself.
You can add them by writing in the configuration file (<code>settings.json</code>) as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;assistant&quot;: {
    &quot;slash_commands&quot;: {
      &quot;refactor&quot;: {
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Refactor the code&quot;,
        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Please refactor the selected code to be more readable and efficient. Please also explain the changes and the reasons for them.&quot;
      },
      &quot;doc&quot;: {
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Generate documentation&quot;,
        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Generate documentation comments in JSDoc format (or a format appropriate for the language) for the selected code.&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>By setting it up like this, you can instantly call up a well-thought-out, high-precision prompt simply by typing <code>/refactor</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use--and-">How to Use <code>@</code> and <code>/</code></h2><ul>
<li><strong><code>@</code> (Context)</strong>: &quot;What&quot; to talk about (file, symbol, document, etc.)</li>
<li><strong><code>/</code> (Command)</strong>: &quot;What&quot; to make it do (explain, modify, generate tests, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining these two, it is possible to <strong>instruct the AI by describing the &quot;target&quot; and &quot;operation&quot; like a command line</strong>, such as:
<code>@main.rs /refactor</code>
This is the key to accelerating the AI experience in Zed.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>By combining history management with Text Thread and calling up routine prompts with slash commands, Zed becomes more than just an editor; it becomes your &quot;own personal development partner.&quot;
In particular, slash commands are fun to develop your own favorite prompts, so be sure to play around with the configuration file.</p>
<p>Have a comfortable Zed life!</p>
