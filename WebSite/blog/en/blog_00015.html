              <section class="post-detail__body markdown-body"><p>Hello! I&#39;m PanKUN.</p>
<p>I decided to try using <strong>p5.js</strong>, which is famous in the world of creative coding.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-p5js">What is p5.js?</h2><p>It is a library that makes Processing, a programming language for art, work on the Web (JavaScript).
Things like &quot;drawing pictures on a canvas&quot; and &quot;moving them&quot; can be written with surprisingly simple code.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-is-super-easy">Introduction is Super Easy</h3><p>There is also a method to install with npm, but this time I introduced it easily with CDN.
Just add one line to HTML.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.0/p5.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Preparation is complete with just this.</p>
<h2 id="let39s-write-immediately">Let&#39;s Write Immediately</h2><p>First, I started from &quot;creating a canvas on the entire screen and displaying a circle&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function setup() {
  // Create a canvas full of screen
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw() {
  // Clear background
  clear();
  
  // Draw a circle (x, y, size)
  circle(100, 100, 50);
}
</code></pre>
<p>I was able to draw with just this.
It is a mechanism where <code>setup()</code> is called only once at the beginning, and <code>draw()</code> is called every frame.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-fly-particles">Trying to Fly Particles</h2><p>If you classify the circle, put it in an array, and update the coordinates, it becomes an animation where countless particles move.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">class Particle {
  constructor() {
    this.x = random(width);
    this.y = random(height);
  }
  
  update() {
    this.y -= 1; // Rise up
  }
  
  display() {
    circle(this.x, this.y, 5);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you loop this inside <code>draw()</code>, the animation rising like bubbles is complete.
If you use vectors and trigonometric functions, you can also create more complex movements.</p>
<h2 id="got-carried-away-and-created-10-patterns">Got Carried Away and Created 10 Patterns</h2><p>It became fun, so I implemented various patterns.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Network</strong>: Connect particles with lines (Neural network style)</li>
<li><strong>Cosmos</strong>: Stars twinkling</li>
<li><strong>Rain</strong>: Digital rain (Matrix style)</li>
<li><strong>Circuit</strong>: Pulses running like a circuit diagram</li>
</ol>
<p>...and so on, a total of 10 types!</p>
<p>I made it switch randomly every time the page is opened, so
you can enjoy a different atmosphere every time you reload.</p>
<h2 id="trap-of-smartphone-measures">Trap of Smartphone Measures</h2><p>One thing I got stuck on during implementation was <strong>occurrence of horizontal scrolling on smartphones</strong>.
If you write
<code>createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)</code>
it is no problem on PC, but on smartphones, the width of the scroll bar is included, and sometimes it slightly exceeds the screen width.</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let w = document.documentElement.clientWidth;
</code></pre>
<p>I solved it by getting the accurate width excluding the scroll bar like this.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>I touched p5.js for the first time, but the experience of <strong>&quot;drawing pictures with code&quot;</strong> was very fresh and fun.</p>
<p>Why don&#39;t you add &quot;a little playfulness&quot; to your site too?</p>
