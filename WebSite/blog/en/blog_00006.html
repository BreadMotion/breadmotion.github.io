              <section class="post-detail__body markdown-body"><p>Hello! I&#39;m PanKUN.</p>
<p>This time, it&#39;s about turning features into plugins, which will be useful for future projects if you keep it in mind when developing UE5 games.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>When creating a certain function of a game, paying attention to the granularity of responsibility has the following merits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintainability
Since functions are grouped together, it is easy to understand the scope of influence of bug fixes and specification changes.</li>
<li>Readability
&quot;Look at this plugin for this function&quot; becomes clear, improving the overall visibility of the project.</li>
<li>Reusability
When taking it to another project, <strong>copy-pasting the plugin or adding dependencies</strong> is all that&#39;s needed.</li>
<li>Compatibility with team development
It is easy to divide roles and draw module boundaries for each person in charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I will summarize focusing on <strong>&quot;what to be conscious of when cutting out as a plugin to make it beneficial&quot;</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="timing-to-be-conscious-of-plugin-creation">Timing to be conscious of plugin creation</h2><p>Personally, if it fits any of the following, I try to stop and consider it as a &quot;candidate for a plugin&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions that are likely to be reused in other projects in the future</li>
<li>When &quot;game-specific logic&quot; and &quot;common mechanisms&quot; start to mix</li>
<li>When it is a &quot;function independent of game execution&quot; such as Editor extensions and tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, <strong>this is not a recommendation to turn everything into plugins</strong>, but rather
<strong>&quot;functions you want to survive across projects&quot;</strong> are easier to benefit from later if separated as plugins from the beginning.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-to-decide-the-granularity-of-responsibility">How to decide the granularity of responsibility</h2><p>The guidelines I often use when deciding the granularity of responsibility are like this.</p>
<h3 id="1-can-it-be-explained-in-one-phrase">1. Can it be explained in one phrase?</h3><p>Whether the description of the plugin can be expressed in one phrase.</p>
<ul>
<li>OK examples:<ul>
<li>This plugin handles <strong>save/load management in the game</strong></li>
<li>This plugin summarizes <strong>camera tracking, shaking, and zoom control</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NG examples:<ul>
<li>It saves, displays UI, and also tweaks enemy parameters</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-how-to-separate-game-dependent-parts">2. How to separate game-dependent parts</h3><p>If the code on the plugin side has direct references to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project-specific GameMode names</li>
<li>Specific character classes</li>
<li>Specific map names</li>
</ul>
<p>Then <strong>reusability drops dramatically</strong>.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugin side: Define abstract interfaces and events</li>
<li>Game side: Implement them and write &quot;concrete processing&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="procedure-for-creating-a-plugin">Procedure for creating a plugin</h2><p>The position of fine buttons changes slightly depending on the UE version, but the flow is like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>In UE5 Editor
<code>Plugins</code> -&gt; Select template from &quot;New Plugin&quot;<ul>
<li>Select according to usage such as Runtime Plugin / Editor Plugin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C++ / BP is generated in <code>Plugins/YourPluginName/</code> of the project</li>
<li>In <code>.uplugin</code> of the plugin, describe<ul>
<li>Module type (Runtime / Editor)</li>
<li>Dependency modules</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the case of C++, write initialization and release processing in <code>StartupModule</code> / <code>ShutdownModule</code> of <code>YourPluginNameModule</code> class</li>
<li>After that, build functions &quot;with the same feeling as normal project code&quot;
However, <strong>be careful not to depend heavily on game-specific names</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There is no need to aim for perfect design from the beginning, first</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a box with a granularity of &quot;This chunk seems like it can be independent as a plugin&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Gradually turn parts you care about into interfaces</strong> while using it</li>
</ol>
<p>Then a &quot;nice boundary of responsibility&quot; will naturally become visible.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="examples-of-failures-that-tend-to-happen-when-creating-plugins">Examples of failures that tend to happen when creating plugins</h2><p>Here are some patterns I got stuck in / saw.</p>
<h3 id="1-stuffing-everything-into-one-plugin">1. Stuffing everything into one plugin</h3><p>If you can no longer explain it in one phrase, it is easier to think that it is time to split the plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a plugin named &quot;Common System&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Save/Load</li>
<li>Common UI parts</li>
<li>Debug console</li>
<li>Network wrapper</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of putting all of them in, it becomes <strong>just a huge project</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-directly-writing-game-specific-classes">2. Directly writing game-specific classes</h3><ul>
<li>Directly referencing <code>AMyGameCharacter</code> or <code>AMyGameGameMode</code> in the plugin code</li>
<li>The moment you take it to the next project, <strong>all compilation errors</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Portability increases dramatically if you use interfaces (<code>UInterface</code> and Delegates) like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have &quot;information the plugin wants&quot; supplied from outside via events or functions</li>
<li>The plugin itself operates on the premise that &quot;someone will implement this&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><ul>
<li>When making a game with UE5, it is easier later if you separate <strong>&quot;functions you want to use in the next project&quot;</strong> as plugins from the beginning</li>
<li>It is easy to organize if you think about the granularity of responsibility based on<ul>
<li>Can it be explained in one phrase?</li>
<li>Is it separated from game-specific parts?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no need to make it perfect suddenly<ul>
<li>First, &quot;Let&#39;s make this function a plugin&quot;</li>
<li>It is realistic to adjust boundaries and interfaces while using it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
